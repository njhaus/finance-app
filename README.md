# Finance

The live version of this project can be found [HERE](https://flask-production-41f7.up.railway.app/login)

Finance is an application built with Python, Flask, and Jinja. It is an app built to practice buying and selling stocks at real-time prices. The app was built as part of Harvard's CS50 course. The file `helpers.py` and some dependencies were provided by the course, but all other code, including routes, templates, tests, and deployment configuration, is my own. Deployment configuration was not a part of the class and was a feature I added on my own.

## How to Use

- Visit [this site](https://flask-production-41f7.up.railway.app/login) to open the app. 
- Use the navigation bar to register or log in.
- Once logged in, use the navigation bar to get a current stock quote, buy or sell a stock, or view your transaction history.
- Make sure to log out when finished!
